**---Three days vacation in Italy---**


### Day 1: July 16, 2018 (Monday)
**Activity**: 
* Failed proof of concept of [Catboost](https://tech.yandex.com/catboost/doc/dg/concepts/r-quickstart-docpage/)
* Narrowed the selection of books to study this summer
* Started walking through Arthur Carpentier's [Classification from Scratch](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/52731)
* Red [reviews](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf) of Efron's CASI, Introduction
* [Podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/147669/744363) from McKinzie's Data Science Consultant on Organizational Change
* Read 5 Mark Edmondson [articles](http://code.markedmondson.me/) on Data Science infrastructure in Google Cloud

**Notes**: Logistic regression is far far from finished. Need to:
* Generalize the functions
* Plot prediction regions via ggplot
* Refresh and work out the mathematical derivation


### Day 2: July 17, 2018 (Tuesday)

**Activity**:
* Implemented [Random Survival Model](https://kogalur.github.io/randomForestSRC/) for Churn Prediction on a small dataset
* Started working on [King County](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/kernels) House Prices prediction
* Talk on [Image Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HOulHAUhQw) for Biochemistry
* Reading from [CASI](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/order.html) for an hour [NOT DONE]

**Notes**: Make a plan to extract the maximum out of the House Pricing dataset (check)


### Day 3: July 18, 2018 (Wednesday)

**Activity**:
* Talk by Lucas Bernardi on [Selection Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZWCKr0vDtc&index=82&list=PLYEK5GJ_Xl7OPrucJhQ32RjafRyEdt5iT) and Propensity Modeling
* King County House pricing implementation [Exploratory Data Analysis]
* ggmap and visualizing geographical data

**Notes**: First unit test in production! R's `ggmap` is amazing.


### Day 4: July 19, 2018 (Thursday)

**Activity**:
* 4 hours of Advanced Python (see [Learning Python Repository](https://github.com/bizovi/hundred_days_ml)). Multithreading and Semaphores, Multiprocessing, Async Programming, Unit Testing
* King County House pricing blog post preparation
* Wrote 5 Unit Tests and refactored BigQuery helper functions

**Notes**: Was too exhausted to read a few pages from CASI


### Day 5: July 20, 2018 (Friday)

**Activity**:
* King County House pricing blog writing and polishing
* Efron and Hastie CASI Chapter One and Two

**Notes**: Reformat the markdown for [bizovi.github.io](https://bizovi.github.io)

### Day 6: July 21, 2018 (Saturday)

**Activity**:
* King County House Prices Exploratory Data Analysis for the blog
* Moscow flats dataset exploration for the blog
* Computerophile on Convolutional Neural Networks, Video Streaming, Lambda Calculus

**Notes**: Prepare for the long road by downloading SanDiego Machine Learning Fundamentals Course Videos.

**---Trip to New York---**

### Day 7: July 22, 2018 (Sunday)

**Activity**:
* Data Science in the Google Cloud from Chapter 3 forward (pag 1-180)
* More editing on house prediction challenges
* Presentations on Feynman's lost lecture, Fermat's Last Theorem and two "bridges", Convolutional Neural Networks

**Notes**: Compute Engine, AppEngine, Data Studio, BigQuery, DataLab, DataFlow, PubSub


### Day 8: July 23, 2018 (Monday)

**Activity**:
* Read Chapter 3 from CASI
* Read Paper on Defensive Programming in R (checkmate)

**Notes**: Unit testing and TDD is appropriate for production stage of ML, in exploratory stages it is rather counter-productive.


### Day 9: July 24, 2018 (Tuesday)

**Activity**:
* Read Chapter 4 from CASI
* Talk on Churn Analysis from booking using ML and Survival Analysis

**Notes**: On a right track with the dual approach of Classification and Survival analysis for Churn,


### Day 10: July 25, 2018 (Wednesday)

**Activity**:
* Read Chapter 5 from CASI
* Publish the EDA phase for King County Home Prices prediction

**Notes**:
