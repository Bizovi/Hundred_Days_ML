# Hundred_Days_ML
Keeping track of ML studies, simulations, articles, books and papers read. Starting date: July 16, 2018.

* Computer Age Statistical Inference by Efron, Hastie
* Finish "Fundamentals of Machine Learning" from SanDiego [edX]
* Fluent Python by Ramalho
* Learning Python by Ascher, Lutz
* Prepare Data Mining Lab Handbook for the fall
* Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by Barber (not quite sure)


### Day -5: July 11, 2018 (Wednesday)
* mlr: machine learning in R (half of the tutorial)
* Transferring XGBoost to mlr architecture
* Talk on Data Mining as Exploratory Analysis (mlr)
* Record the most recent presentation on Machine Learning

### Day -4: July 12, 2018 (Thursday)
* XGBoost with Bayesian Optimization of hyperparameters [Adore Me]
* 4 hours of Advanced Python (see Learning Python Repository)
* Talk and Notes on Catboost algorithm developed by Yandex
**Three days vacation in Italy**


### Day 1: July 16, 2018 (Monday
**Activity**: 
* Failed proof of concept of Catboost
* Narrowed the selection of books to study this summer
* Started walking through Arthur Carpentier's Classification from Scratch
* Red reviews of Efron's CASI, Introduction
* Podcast from McKinzie's Data Science Consultant on Organizational Change
* Read 5 Mark Edmondson articles on Data Science infrastructure in Google Cloud

**Notes**: Logistic regression is far far from finished. Need to:
* Generalize the functions
* Plot prediction regions via ggplot
* Refresh and work out the mathematical derivation


### Day 2: July 17, 2018

**Activity**:
* Implemented Random Survival Model for Churn Prediction on a small dataset
* Started working on King County House Prices prediction
* Talk on Selection Bias in Machine Learning and Image Processing for Biochemistry
* Reading from CASI for an hour

**Notes**: Make a plan to extract the maximum out of the House Pricing dataset
