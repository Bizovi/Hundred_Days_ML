# Hundred days of (not only) Machine Learning

An important part of learning and trying to be on top of latest developments is
 being consistent, keeping track of papers, books, notes and code. After
 filling the shelves with handwritten notes, I needed a better way to manage
 the content. This repository has two components:
 
* A chronological timeline of papers and books read, conferences attended and
 experiments done. 
* A [wiki](https://github.com/Bizovi/Hundred_Days_ML/wiki) with a curated
 list of resources by topic, with links to my code (when appropriate) or
 other repositories.
* The content from last year will be in `archive/` and gradually revised for
 the curated list.


### September 28, 2019 (Saturday)
* Yanis Varoufakis - [Talking to my daughter about the economy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Talking-Daughter-About-Economy-Capitalism/dp/1847924441): A brief
 history of capitalism
* Kent Beck - [Test-Driven Development](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Test-Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8TA4GZ66UV7W&keywords=test+driven+development&qid=1569760735&s=books&sprefix=test+driven%2Cstripbooks%2C176&sr=1-1) by example

*"Talking to my daughter about the economy"* makes for delightful three hours
 of reading, but don't underestimate this book in terms of **impact** and its
 *implicit* references to the following topics, which I'm going to interpret in
 my own way:
 
* Joseph Stiglitz - [The Price of Inequality](https://www.amazon.com/Price-Inequality-Divided-Society-Endangers-ebook/dp/B007MKCQ30/ref=sr_1_1?crid=RY9R0J7Z3OXP&keywords=stiglitz+inequality&qid=1569762899&s=gateway&sprefix=stiglitz+ine%2Caps%2C249&sr=8-1): 
How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future. I would recommend Stiglitz
over Piketti on this topic, but that's just me.
* Francis Fukuyama - [The origins of political order](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fukuyama+origins+of+political+order&crid=3E7E0HPDGZMEO&sprefix=fukuyama+origin%2Caps%2C249&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_15), 
[Political order and political decay](https://www.amazon.com/Political-Order-Decay-Industrial-Globalization/dp/0374535620/ref=sr_1_2?crid=Z7TBID6YIOMK&keywords=fukuyama+political+order&qid=1569763203&s=gateway&sprefix=fukuyama+politica%2Caps%2C-1&sr=8-2). 
A comparative analysis on the emergence of states, rule of law, democratic
 accountability and political decay. Their interplay is an important topic in
 order to better understand the economic context.
* Great Britain's transition from a society with markets to a society of
markets, with an accent on labor. Experiential value in contrast with exchange
 value.
* [Minsky's](https://www.amazon.com/Stabilizing-Unstable-Economy-Hyman-Minsky/dp/0071592997/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=minsky&qid=1569763645&s=gateway&sr=8-3) idea of inherent instability, the dynamics of debt and profits
, money, deflation, employment. The [Goodwin-Lotka-Volterra](https://www.systemdynamics.org/assets/conferences/2005/proceed/papers/WEBER196.pdf) model is an
 elegant mathematical representation of this idea.
* (Common) expectations, markets and self-fulfilling prophecies. How a WWII
 [prisoner camp market](http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~yitingli/file/Money%20and%20Banking/The%20Economic%20Organisation%20of%20a%20P.O.W.%20Camp.pdf) differs from the real world.
* [The economics of money and banking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking), 
the political nature of money ([Where does money come from?](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Does-Money-Come-Ryan-Collins/dp/1521043892/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=where+does+money+come+from&qid=1569763978&s=gateway&sr=8-1)).
* Elinor Ostrom - [Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action](https://www.amazon.com/Governing-Commons-Evolution-Institutions-Collective/dp/1107569788/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=elinor+ostrom&qid=1569764070&s=gateway&sr=8-1)
and the "Tragedy of the commons".

**Other important works by Y. Varoufakis:** The list below is the books read
, although "And the Weak Suffer What They Must?", "The global minotaur" also
 deserve attention. 

* [Economic Indeterminacy](https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Indeterminacy-encounter-economists-Routledge-ebook/dp/B00FQGQH9G/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=economic+indeterminacy&qid=1569762217&s=gateway&sr=8-1): 
A personal encounter with the economists' peculiar nemesis
* [Adults In the Room](https://www.amazon.com/Adults-Room-European-American-Establishment/dp/0374538050/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3MQOW45ATP1AE&keywords=adults+in+the+room&qid=1569762306&s=gateway&sprefix=adults+in+the+room%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-1): My Battle with the European and American Deep
 Establishment
* [Game Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Theory-Shaun-Hargreaves-Heap/dp/0415094038/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=game+theory+varoufakis&qid=1569762342&s=gateway&sr=8-1): 
A critical introduction


### September 29, 2019 (Sunday)

* Jurgen Appelo - [Management 3.0](https://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=agile+management+3.0&qid=1569764229&s=gateway&sr=8-1): 
Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders **[Chapters 1-5]**

Me, as other people who were drawn to this book absolutely hate cookbook-style 
management books, for a good reason, especially if coming from a scientific
 background. Jurgen draws sound connections between the complexity theory and
  self-organizing teams, providing an invaluable counterpart to the numerous
  materials on Agile software development.
