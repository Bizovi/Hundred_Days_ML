* King County House pricing implementation [Exploratory Data Analysis]
* ggmap and visualizing geographical data

**Notes**: First unit test in production! R's `ggmap` is amazing.


### Day 4: July 19, 2018 (Thursday)

**Activity**:
* 4 hours of Advanced Python (see [Learning Python Repository](https://github.com/bizovi/hundred_days_ml)). Multithreading and Semaphores, Multiprocessing, Async Programming, Unit Testing
