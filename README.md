# Hundred days of Machine Learning

An important part of learning and trying to be on top of latest developments is
 being consistent, keeping track of papers, books, notes and code. After
 filling the shelves with handwritten notes, I needed a better way to manage
 the content. This repository will have two components:
 
* A chronological timeline of papers and books read, conferences attended and
 experiments done. 
* A [wiki](https://github.com/Bizovi/Hundred_Days_ML/wiki) with a curated
 list of resources by topic, with links to my code (when appropriate) or
 other repositories.
* The content from last year will be in `archive/` and gradually revised for
 the curated list.
